#Mandrill + Angular
This is an attempt at learning how to create client-side apps with [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org) as well as figuring out how to send emails without the use of a CMS or a backend that I have to deploy myself. I decided to use [Mandrill](http://www.mandrill.com) for these purposes, since they give a very generous free tier (20k messages per month free!).

The ultimate goal of this exercise for me is an attempt to see which of the three big JS MV* frameworks ([Backbone](http://www.backbonejs.org),[Angular](http://www.angularjs.org), or [Ember](http://www.emberjs.com)) are best for progressive enhancement, that is, iteratively adding functionality to a static web page that is either bare or has some jquery code tacked on.

This implementation demonstrates the following things with Angular:

  * basic scaffolding
  * Controllers
  * Resources with multiple routes
  * Validation

When I've finished building this with the other frameworks, I'll likely write something about my experiences.
Until then, enjoy. I'm using [Middleman](http://www.middlemanapp.com) to build the site itself, so if you want to hack it up, you might want a working install of that going.
